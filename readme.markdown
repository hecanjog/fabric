## Feb 2013: Fabric has been renamed to Pippi and moved

[Find Pippi here](http://github.com/hecanjog/pippi)

### Why?

There is already a well known (unrelated) python package called Fabric!

Pippi now also includes an optional 'realtime' (and linux-only) command-based performance layer.

Fabric is a computer music system written with the Python v2.x standard library.
It is intended to be used for offline/non-realtime computer music composition. 

It aims to be highly portable, hackable, understandable and powerful. 

A roadmap and some documentation can be found on [the fabric website](http://fabric-dsp.com)
