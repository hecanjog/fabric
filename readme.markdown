#Pocket Suite by He Can Jog
##A collection of python scores for the Pocket Fields netlabel.
###Fall 2011 - Spring 2012 (CC) BY-NC-SA

These pieces are mostly synthesis studies. I was writing the 
synthesis routines for Fabric while I worked on them.

To generate the pieces, first make sure you have the sounds 
needed and then run each score.

Below is a list of the sounds you'll need - place them in the 
sounds/ directory.

From freesound.org: horn.wav
From freesound.org: ice.wav

To generate a score, open a terminal or command prompt, and 
cd to this directory, then just run:

    python score.py

Where score.py is the name of the score you would like to generate.

Please feel free to tinker with the code and make variations. I'd 
love to hear them! erik@hecanjog.com
