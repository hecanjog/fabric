{"name":"Fabric","body":"# Fabric\r\n\r\n[Fabric source on github](http://github.com/hecanjog/fabric/)\r\n\r\nFabric is a computer music system written with the Python v2.x standard library.\r\nIt is intended to be used for offline/non-realtime computer music composition. \r\n\r\nIt aims to be highly portable, hackable, understandable and powerful. \r\n\r\nDocumentation is sparse at the moment, but you can check out the example score.py \r\nscript for an overview of some features.\r\n\r\nThe system currently implements simple wavetable synthesis and provides tools for\r\nprocessing sound in the time domain. Frequency domain tools may be added if the \r\nauthor learns how that darn FFT works, or when support for pluggable DSP engines \r\nis implemented in version 3.\r\n\r\n## Fabric quickstart\r\n\r\nGenerate a stereo 30 second sinewave at 300hz and save it\r\nas sinewave.wav\r\n    \r\n    import dsp\r\n    \r\n    out = dsp.tone(length=dsp.stf(30), freq=300.0, wavetype='sine2pi')\r\n    \r\n    dsp.write(out, filename='sinewave', timestamp=False)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Fabric Roadmap\r\n\r\n### Version 1\r\n\r\n- Full test coverage\r\n- Standardized install process\r\n- Document install process\r\n- Document template score to show:\r\n    - Loading and manipulating sounds\r\n    - Layering, gain adjustment, basic editing\r\n    - Synthesis and wavetable generation\r\n    - Rendering\r\n- All methods w/at least stub docstring description\r\n\r\n### Version 2\r\n\r\n- Optimize codebase (find speed bottlenecks and eliminate where possible)\r\n- Fully document source\r\n- First tutorials for the absolute beginner \r\n(Draw from Miller Puckett's PD book, David Cottle's SC book, FLOSS Manuals PD book)\r\n- Expand synthesis capabilities: FM, etc\r\n- Expand 'high level' functionality: compression, reverb?\r\n\r\n### The Future... \r\n\r\n- Integration with [Sugar](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org) environment\r\n- Explore plugin system for modular synthesis engines (libpd, csound, supercollider, etc)\r\n- Full lesson plans for age groups Logo is targeted toward\r\n- Complete support for all major platforms","tagline":"Music with the Python standard library.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
